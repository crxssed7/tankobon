# Tankōbon

## What is Tankōbon?

Manga chapters are often split into volumes (think about how TV shows are split into seasons) which is what we call the Tankōbon format, however, so far I haven't found any central place that documents what chapter is in which volume. This hobby project is an attempt to fix that, and make life easier for those who categorise their manga into volumes.

## What happened to the live instance?

On the 25th August, Heroku announced that all free Dynos and Heroku Postgres will become unavailable and that free accounts will need to be upgraded. I chose to use Heroku initally because it was free, easy to use, and I hadn't had much experience with cloud computing. However, now that I am learning cloud, I've chosen to not upgrade my Heroku account and use a better known platform like AWS or Azure. Tankōbon will kept offline and inaccessible until then. (No accounts or data will be lost, I have taken a backup :smile:).
